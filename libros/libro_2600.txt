fired either side twenty sixth battle borodinó took place battles shevárdino borodinó given accepted battle borodinó fought least sense either french russians immediate result russians bound brought nearer destruction moscow feared anything world french immediate result brought nearer destruction whole army feared anything world result must quite obvious yet napoleon offered kutúzov accepted battle commanders guided reason would seem must obvious napoleon advancing thirteen hundred miles giving battle probability losing quarter army advancing certain destruction must equally clear kutúzov accepting battle risking loss quarter army would certainly lose moscow kutúzov mathematically clear playing draughts one man less go exchanging shall certainly lose therefore exchange opponent sixteen men fourteen one eighth weaker exchanged thirteen men three times strong battle borodinó strength proportion french five six battle little one two previously hundred thousand hundred twenty thousand afterwards little fifty thousand hundred thousand yet shrewd experienced kutúzov accepted battle napoleon said commander genius gave losing quarter army lengthening lines communication still said expected end campaign occupying moscow ended previous campaign occupying vienna much evidence contrary napoleon historians tell us smolénsk onwards wished stop knew danger extended position knew occupation moscow would end campaign seen smolénsk state russian towns left received single reply repeated announcements wish negotiate giving accepting battle borodinó kutúzov acted involuntarily irrationally later fit occurred historians provided cunningly devised evidence foresight genius generals blind tools history enslaved involuntary ancients left us model heroic poems heroes furnish whole interest story still unable accustom fact epoch histories kind meaningless question battle borodinó preceding battle shevárdino fought also exists definite well known quite false conception historians describe affair follows russian army say retreat smolénsk sought best position general engagement found position borodinó russians say fortified position advance left highroad moscow smolénsk almost right angle borodinó utítsa place battle fought front position say fortified outpost set shevárdino mound observe enemy twenty fourth told napoleon attacked advanced post took twenty sixth attacked whole russian army position field borodinó histories say quite wrong anyone cares look matter easily convince russians seek best position contrary retreat passed many positions better borodinó stop one positions kutúzov wish occupy position chosen popular demand battle yet expressed strongly enough milorádovich yet arrived militia many reasons fact positions passed stronger position borodinó one battle fought far strong position spot one might find russian empire sticking pin map hazard russians fortify position field borodinó left right angle highroad position battle took place never till twenty fifth august 1812 think battle might fought shown first fact entrenchments twenty fifth begun twenty fifth twenty sixth completed secondly position shevárdino redoubt redoubt quite senseless front position battle accepted strongly fortified post efforts exhausted six thousand men sacrificed defend till late night twenty fourth cossack patrol would sufficed observe enemy thirdly proof position battle fought foreseen shevárdino redoubt advanced post position fact twenty fifth barclay tolly bagratión convinced shevárdino redoubt left flank position kutúzov report written hot haste battle speaks shevárdino redoubt left flank position much later reports battle borodinó written leisure incorrect extraordinary statement invented probably justify mistakes commander chief represented infallible shevárdino redoubt advanced post whereas reality simply fortified point left flank battle borodinó fought us entrenched position previously selected whereas fought quite unexpected spot almost unentrenched case evidently position selected along river kolochá crosses highroad right angle acute angle left flank shevárdino right flank near village nóvoe center borodinó confluence rivers kolochá vóyna anyone looks field borodinó without thinking battle actually fought position protected river kolochá presents obvious army whose object prevent enemy advancing along
